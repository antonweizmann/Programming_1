1. A for loop needs to know the number of iterations before starting and cannot run indefinetly.
A while loop however can have an undefined number of iterations at complie time.
This is means if you dont know the number of iterations the loop will have to do a while loop has to be used.

2. If you imagine namespaces as a set of layer, it first looks in its local namespace (the first layer)
 Then it goes up one level and checks there. It repeats this until it reaches the global namespace.
  After the global namespace it would then look at the builtin variables.
 If for example you call a function from another function then there would be three layers.
