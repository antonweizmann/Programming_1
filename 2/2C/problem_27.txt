1. the continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration
    the break statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next code after the loop. The loop stops

2. you use continue when you are done with the current iteration and want to start the next one.
    lets say you want to print all odd number form 1 - 10. you would do a for loop in range(10) and simply if i is a even number you do continue and go to the next iteration

    You can use break to for example stop the for loop in case there is an error

3. A for loop is useful when a repetition of certain tasks is needed. The structure of the for loop is then simply depends on what tasks you need to repeat. Do you need to do something a certain number of times use range(), do you need to print all parts of a certain data structure loop over the structure with a for loop, etc.
