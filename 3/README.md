This project is for the Programming 1 course in the Artificial Intelligence Bachelor at Radboud University

I will be making an application that evaluates the length of input books. 
It will do this by reading the file, taking the word count and then comparing that to the "average" length of a book (which I will define)
It will then return the number of "normal" books the input book is equal to, the word count itself.

my_input(int n)
    A function that uses try and except statements to ensure that the entered input is accepted.
    The integer n is used to switch between different input modes (what the program expects to receive).
    0 is used for integers.
    1 is used for strings.
